The config script language of emacs: Scheme
  Compared with VIM config language, emacs config language seems too powerful(about 2014). In about 2014, Bram Moolenaar, 
the author of VIM declared that there is a plan to upgrade VIM config language to make it a more advanced 
scripting language. So why a config file could be such complicated that we even need a langage to support it? The truth is 
that there is demands for it. If you say that Emacs is not an IDE, some people would argue with you. 
  We all know that Scheme language is just a dialect of the magic language LISP. But what you may not know is that the father 
of Scheme Language, Guy Lewis Steele Jr., is also the father of Common LISP, and the father of Emacs. This man is great. I 
suggest to read his biography.

    Although the config language is a kind of Scheme, it is a little different with the others. It is dynamic scoped language.
  It is a little complicated to explain the difference. Maybe some of you are not intersted in it. But I think, computer 
  language, is the most beautiful thing to a programmer. I will still say a couple of words about it. For detais, please
